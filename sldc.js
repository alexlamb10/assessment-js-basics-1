// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, where developers look at what the application must do and what is required to make that happen."
const design = "This is the third step. Developers will design the application, anything from what it will look like to how users may interact with the application. They will design this all out so they can begin working on the application."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step. This is the step where developers begin writing code to carry out their plans they have made previously."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step. This is the where the application is almost complete so the application is tested for any bugs that may need to be fixed, the application is then deployed to the public."
const maintain = "This is the final step. This step never finishes, the entire time users use this people may find more bugs or things that need to be fixed. This happens throughout the lifetime of the application."
